markdown# 🤖 CrewAI Learning Journey

My journey learning to build AI agents using the CrewAI framework.

## 📚 What I've Built

### 1. First AI Agent (`my_first_agent.py`)
- Created my first AI agent using CrewAI
- Agent provides interesting facts about artificial intelligence
- Uses Groq's Llama 3.3 model

### 2. News Reporter Agent (`news_agent_with_search.py`)
- AI agent that can scrape real websites
- Fetches current news headlines
- Demonstrates giving agents tools (web scraping capability)

### 3. Tool Discovery (`check_tools.py`)
- Script to explore available tools in CrewAI
- Learned about the extensive tool ecosystem

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12**
- **CrewAI Framework** - Multi-agent orchestration
- **Groq API** - Fast LLM inference
- **CrewAI Tools** - Web scraping and search capabilities

## 🚀 Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install crewai crewai-tools python-dotenv

# Add your API key to .env file
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 📖 What I Learned

- Setting up Python development environment
- Working with virtual environments
- Using API keys securely with environment variables
- Creating AI agents with different roles and goals
- Giving agents tools to interact with the real world
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## 🎯 Next Steps

- [ ] Build multi-agent teams that collaborate
- [ ] Add more sophisticated tools
- [ ] Create a practical real-world project
- [ ] Explore other AI frameworks
